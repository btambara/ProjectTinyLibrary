# ProjectTinyLibrary
This project is to create a global library of tiny libraries. This application allows the client to add/remove/edit libraries. 
Future Features:
-Login/Logout
-Dashboard for User (Favorite Tiny Libraries, Own Tiny Libraries)
-Seachable area for books. Should be able to filter by distance.
